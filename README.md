### GitLab Certified Associate Hands On Exam:

## Project Description:

Welcome to my project. My name is Bravish Ghosh.

Created a new branch `work` and making this line change.

# [EDIT] 

## YAY! I have successfully completed the course!!!

### Feedback:

It was an amazing experience. I learned a lot about GitLab and it felt like a wonderful bootcamp. I enjoyed the quizzes a lot as they cleared lots of minute concepts and served as a revision after reading and watching the tutorials. I loved the hands on project as it was easy but complete hands on experience with GitLab. This course definitely changed my misconception that GitHub is th only good DevOps platform, and now I'm sure that GitLab will rise a lot and become very popular soon.

### Thank you so much!

### CI/CD with Auto DevOps

This template is compatible with [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/).

If Auto DevOps is not already enabled for this project, you can [turn it on](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/#enabling-auto-devops) in the project settings.
